    <h1>Mike Athey - Personal Website Project</h1>
    <p>My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:</p>
    <br>
<h2>Sections of the Website</h2>
    <p><b>Signature:</b>An image of the signature I used in my artwork, subtitled with my name.</p>

    <p><b>About Me:</b> This section will provide a summary of my working background, experience, and skills. It will include a bulleted list of software and platforms I am familiar with for quick reference. The tone of this section will be straightforward and simple for ease of reading.</p>

    <p><b>Portfolio:</b> I want this to be a clean, simple scrolling image gallery containing examples of my best work. Gallery pop-up will include my role and contributions to each project, with a short blurb for each explaining their individual context.</p>

    <p><b>Contact:</b> This section will contain a simple contact form, my professional email, and additional links to my professional social media presence on LinkedIn, Instagram, and GitHub (These will also be linked to in the footer site wide via icons.)</p>
