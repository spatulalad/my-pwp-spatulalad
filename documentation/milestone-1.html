</head>
<h1>Milestone 1</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>I would like my PWP to help advertise my artwork and other creations, providing a showcase for prospective employers and anybody else interested in my work.</p>

<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>The site will be seen by potential employers, fellow artists, customers, and anybody interested in my art.
</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>To serve as a gallery to showcase and promote your work.</p>

<h1>Persona</h1>
<p>Name: Harold Bloomfield</p>
<p>Harold is a representative of the City of Albuquerque's arts council.
    He has access to a Windows 11 desktop PC and an Iphone 14.
    He is broadly familiar with Microsoft Office (particularly Excel), most web browsers, and social media platforms.
    Harold likes discovering new artists and their work both on and offline, and frequents a few Instagram feeds dedicated to local creatives.
    He is currently tasked to scout out new prospects to buy art from to decorate a new government building downtown.
    There are two other council members who are also looking for work, and when they have gathered enough potential hires, they will meet to whittle down the list and select a handful of artists and works.
</p>
<p>Harold is frustrated by the difficulty in finding some artists' online portfolios. They dislike when websites don't function properly on mobile devices as they often show other people art pieces via their smartphone.
</p>
<p>
    Harold's goals for the use of my site are to check out my art and other work to see if I'd be a good fit for the city.
    He plans to use the information gathered there with the rest of the art council as part of their deliberations.
    He will also use the contact info on the website if it turns out I fit his vision of the project.
